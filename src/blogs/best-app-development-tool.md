### Why choose React for Frontend Web Development?



There are many frameworks and libraries available for frontend development but I chose to start Front End Development with React JS for many reasons. First of all, it’s easy to learn and easy to use. In fact, react compared to other popular frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue is much easier to learn. it doesn’t take much time to learn this technology, you can quickly begin to build things with it. If a technology is hard to learn, you will probably find it difficult to start. That, as it happens, it’s human nature. We avoid things that are hard to learn. Moreover, React Js helps to build rich user interfaces. In fact, Quality of user-interfaces is important because a poorly designed user-interface is generally less user-friendly and the users will not like a poorly designed UI. We can build cool interfaces with other technologies too, but React lets you do it easily using the declarative components. I can add that one of the most important reasons why I chose React is the Reusable elements: Each React project is constructed using the so-called reusable elements which means that by calling from other components, each element of the interface that you have already built can be used anywhere in your project. Finally, we shouldn’t forget the Strong community support of React : a lot of experts are also regularly uploading free React tutorials on Youtube and writing in-depth React tutorial articles & blogs on the internet.
